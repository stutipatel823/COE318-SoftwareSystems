Q1. The count value for myAnimal object will be 1. Since Pig() and Dog() are subclasses of the Animal class, 
the main method cannot make direct pig and dog objects. Both myPig and myDog need to be downcasted. 
By changing the last two objects to 
Pig myPig = (Pig) myAnimal; 
Dog myDog = (Dog) myAnimal;  
Q2. Implementing “static” to the count variable 
would give the same result as before. There would be no changes.
